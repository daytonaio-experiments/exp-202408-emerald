### Intelligent Code Base Embedding and Query System

**Job to be Done:**

**When** developers and development teams need an efficient way to search, understand, and utilize large codebases,

**We want to** create a system that uses vector databases (for example ChromaDB or Postgres/pgvector) to generate and store embeddings of the entire codebase from a GitHub repository.

**So that** developers can quickly find and understand code snippets, dependencies, and the overall structure, with potential for creating new features on top of this.

### Objectives

1. **Code Chunking:** Develop a strategy for breaking down large codebases into manageable chunks suitable for embedding.
2. **Embedding Generation:** Select an appropriate embedding model that is fast, reliable, and has long-term support.
3. **Vector Storage:** Integrate with a vector database to store the generated embeddings efficiently.
4. **Search and Query:** Implement a powerful search and query system that leverages the embeddings for quick and precise code retrieval.
5. **Best Practices and Strategies:** Research and document the best practices for chunking and embedding codebases to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
6. **API Exposure:** Expose an API for performing search, query, and other relevant actions to facilitate integration with other systems and tools.

### High-Level Functional Specification for Intelligent Code Base Embedding and Query System

#### Overview
This document outlines the functional specification for an AI-driven system that generates and stores embeddings for entire codebases from GitHub repositories. This system uses vector databases to allow developers to efficiently search and understand large codebases, leveraging embeddings for precise code retrieval and analysis.

#### Functional Requirements

**1. Code Chunking**
- **Chunking Strategy:**
  - Develop a strategy for breaking down code into chunks. This can be done by splitting files into methods/functions, or by a fixed number of lines for larger functions/methods. Or mix strategy, or something completely different.
  - Ensure chunks are semantically meaningful to preserve context, such as comments and import statements within the same chunk.
- **Chunking Implementation:**
  - Implement chunking using a scripting language like Python to preprocess the codebase.
  - Store metadata about each chunk, including file path, chunk number, and surrounding context.

**2. Embedding Generation**
- **Model Selection:**
  - Use a reliable and well-supported embedding model that can be considered for their efficiency and long-term support.
- **Embedding Process:**
  - Develop a pipeline to generate embeddings for each chunk of code.
  - Integrate with embedding model or API provider for embedding generation.
  - Ensure embeddings are generated quickly to handle large codebases. This should be a background task but devise metrics to asses nevertheless.

**3. Vector Storage**
- **Vector Database Integration:**
  - Use a vector database such as Qdrant, ChromaDB or Postgres/pgvector to store the generated embeddings. Research the best option for this specific use case.
  - Design a schema that stores embeddings along with their metadata to allow for efficient retrieval.
- **Storage Optimization:**
  - Optimize the storage for speed and scalability, ensuring quick searches and minimal latency.

**4. Search and Query**
- **Search Implementation:**
  - Develop a search system that can query the vector database using embedding vectors to find similar code chunks.
  - Implement a frontend for developers to input search queries and view results.
- **Query Optimization:**
  - Optimize the search queries for speed and accuracy, leveraging nearest neighbor algorithms.
  - Implement filters to narrow down search results based on file type, programming language, or other metadata.

**5. Best Practices and Strategies**
- **Chunking Strategy Best Practices:**
  - Document best practices for chunking code, such as preserving semantic meaning and maintaining context.
  - Research and recommend chunk sizes that balance granularity and context preservation.
- **Embedding Model Best Practices:**
  - Recommend embedding models that are fast, reliable, and supported long-term.
  - Document strategies for handling code-specific nuances in embedding generation.
- **Storage and Query Strategies:**
  - Provide guidelines on optimizing vector storage for scalability and speed.
  - Recommend query strategies for efficient and accurate search results.

**6. API Exposure**
- **API Development:**
  - Develop a comprehensive RESTful API to expose functionalities for search, query, and other relevant actions.
  - Ensure the API supports authentication and authorization to secure access to the codebase embeddings.
  - Design endpoints for key operations such as searching for code chunks, retrieving embedding metadata, and managing embeddings.
- **Documentation:**
  - Provide thorough documentation for the API, including usage examples, endpoint descriptions, and authentication methods.
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Conduct integration testing to ensure the API works seamlessly with other systems and tools used by developers.
- **Scalability:**
  - Ensure the API can handle high volumes of requests and scale as needed.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability:**
  - Ensure the system can handle large codebases with millions of lines of code.
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize chunking, embedding generation, and storage for speed.
  - Ensure search queries return results quickly.
- **Usability:**
  - Provide a user-friendly interface for searching and querying code.
- **Reliability:**
  - Ensure high accuracy in chunking, embedding generation, and search results.
- **Maintainability:**
  - Implement modular and maintainable code to facilitate future enhancements and updates.
  
#### Deployment and Integration (Optional)
- **Integration:**
  - Seamlessly integrate the embedding and search system with existing Daytona CLI and workflows.
- **Deployment:**
  - Deploy the solution within the existing infrastructure, supporting both cloud-based and local environments.

#### Future Enhancements
- **Interactive Search Customization:**
  - Allow users to interactively refine and customize their search queries.
- **Continuous Learning:**
  - Track and log search interactions to improve the systemâ€™s accuracy and efficiency over time.
- **Multimodal Embeddings:**
  - Explore the use of multimodal embeddings that combine code with other relevant data, such as documentation or commit history, for enhanced search capabilities.

By implementing this intelligent code base embedding and query system, Daytona users will be empowered to efficiently navigate and understand large codebases, boosting productivity and collaboration significantly. The addition of a RESTful API will further extend the system's utility by allowing seamless integration with other tools and workflows.
